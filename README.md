##### Author: Dmitry Demin

This app can be used to control your hue lights. It can automatically detect your bridge IP and help you setup your userID. App will automatically collect information about all lights connected to the hub and list them for you to choose.

The menus render depending on lights capabilities - does the light have color selection, temperature control, etc.
